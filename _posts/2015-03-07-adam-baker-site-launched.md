Thanks to the tutorial created by [Jonathan McGlone](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) I was able to easily get this [Jekyll-powered](http://jekyllrb.com) blog up and running on [GitHub](http://github.com). I chose this route because of a couple reasons. First of all, I've been interested in using GitHub, but have difficulty in finding a good reason to create an account and use it. Secondly, I can use Markdown to write posts. Markdown is, in my opinion, a great improvement over HTML manliny due to the fact that there are no tags and awkard "<" & ">" characters mixed in with text. Granted, there's some syntax to learn, but that's ok trade-off in order to gain simplicity. I'm quite pleased so far, in future weeks I'll take a stab at modifying the style and posting about that (or other topics) in the future.
